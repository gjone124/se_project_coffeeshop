# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- the menu would look better if the prices were all formatted the same
  ($1.00, $1.25, & $1.50 instead of $1, $1.25, $1.5)
- the navigation links on the first page would look better if they were all capitalized ("Book A Table" instead of "Book a table")
- under the menu, the "Party-size" cup would look better capitalized as "Party-Size" like the other items on the menu
